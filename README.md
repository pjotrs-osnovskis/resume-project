# Resume Project

This is my first mini project with Code Institute called "Resume Project".

## Description

This project is based on Code Istitute guidance and will be created to their standarts following their guide. It is created primarily using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 4 and minimal JavaScript code when using Bootstrap 4. Idea behind this project is to learn in practice all theory that was shown before, plus create a resume application for myself to be used in the future.

## Roadmap

I think I will amend this project alongside with the course and add/change features and  it's design accordingly.
